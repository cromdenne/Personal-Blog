It was the biggest, baddest Wisconsin blizzard of my lifetime... and we spent it
in San Francisco.

Don't get me wrong, we were certainly happy to trade the April snow for the
mild weather of the Bay Area!<!-- end_excerpt --> This was going to be the
longest and farthest trip for Taylor and I since our honeymoon in St. Lucia,
and we had planned it out a couple months in advance with some travel hacking
strategies (details are in my next post if you're interested).

The trip was excellent and we were disappointed to have to leave the beautiful
weather, especially considering what we returned to.

#### Day 1
Our trip began early Wednesday morning with a flight out of Green Bay at
6:00AM. We had booked our tickets on United Airlines because of the rewards
points we'd accumulated, and this was our first experience with United.
Everything went smoothly, and we arrived in San Francisco around noon local
time after a connection in Chicago. I certainly appreciated the relative calm
of all three airports for early-morning midweek flights, and I think we'll try
to plan future trips on a similar schedule.

After finding a shuttle from SFO to our hotel near Fisherman's Wharf
([SuperShuttle](https://www.supershuttle.com/){:
.underline-effect}{:target="blank"} turned out to be the easiest option with a
reasonable price, and we'd use them again), we had a relaxed afternoon to
explore our surroundings. Our first destination was the Wharf itself.

    we ended up checking in on them each day!</p>

After grabbing some food at one of the many restaurants, we explored a few
shops and wandered to the end of the pier with the sea lions. They're
interesting creatures, and Taylor loved watching them flop around looking for
prime napping real estate and playfully fighting each other.

After we'd had enough of the sea lions' shenanigans for one afternoon we
explored a bit more and eventually made our way to Ghirardelli Square. I'm a
sucker for good ice cream, so this wasn't our last trip to the hallowed
chocolate company. We came home with a lot of chocolate after we discovered
later in the week that we could get a ton of free samples by walking through 
each of the four shop areas within 10 minutes...

We wrapped up our first day with a bit more sightseeing around the area and
then headed back to the hotel to relax and plan our trip to Muir Woods
National Monument the next morning.
